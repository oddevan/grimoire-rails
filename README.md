# Grimoire

An app to track your Pokémon Trading Card Game collection.

This is a rewrite of [the original WordPress implementation][wp] and, as such, is not quite at feature parity.

## Features

### Currently

- Powered by [TCGplayer]'s comprehensive catalog
- Inferrable IDs based on card set, number, and printing
- Identifies copies of cards within a set and across multiple sets

### To reach feature parity

- Browse the catalog and see latest prices
- Register for an account to track your cards:
  - Create multiple collections
  - Quickly find the most valuable cards
  - Your data is yours: export as a CSV at any time

### Future

- Get detailed card information from [Pokémon TCG Developers](https://pokemontcg.io)
- Quickly filter your collection by type, legality, or other attributes
- Publish collections or decks to your profile

### Very far future and will probably charge for

- Mark cards "for sale" and sync with your TCGplayer inventory?
- Use your own TCGplayer affiliate code on your profile/decks?
